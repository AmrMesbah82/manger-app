/// File Name: 69-cross_axis_count_helper.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `CrossAxisCountHelper` — how many cards fit in a row, and
///          the one grid delegate every card grid in the app is built on.
/// Author: Manger Plus team
/// Created: 3/9/2026
/// Updated: 19/9/2026 - Added `getCrossAxisCountForDefaultTablet2` (the
///          knowticed_plus helper, made web-safe) and `gridDelegate`, so a
///          card grid never hand-rolls its own column maths again.
///
/// Ported from knowticed_plus with one deliberate change: the original branches
/// on `Platform.isMacOS || isWindows || isLinux`, which THROWS on web because
/// `dart:io` has no Platform there. Wash ships a web build of the console, so
/// this reads the platform through [PlatformHelper] instead, which answers the
/// same question on every target.
