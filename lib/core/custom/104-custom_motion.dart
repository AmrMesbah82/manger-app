/// File Name: 104-custom_motion.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `AppMotion`, `AnimateInList`, `AnimatedCount` and
///          `SectionTransition` — the console's shared motion vocabulary,
///          built on the app's existing `Entrance` widget (102).
/// Author: Manger Plus team
/// Created at: 8/9/2026 - Added so every dashboard page arrives the same way
///          instead of appearing fully formed between one frame and the next.
///
/// WHY ONE FILE
/// ------------
/// Motion is a house rule like colour is. Six screens each picking their own
/// duration and curve is how an app ends up feeling assembled rather than
/// designed — one card easing in over 600ms next to another snapping in over
/// 120ms reads as a bug even when both are deliberate. Everything here comes
/// out of [AppMotion], and no screen writes its own `Duration`.
///
/// THE BUDGET
/// ----------
/// This is a console someone has open all day, so the animation has to be
/// invisible on the tenth visit and only felt on the first. That means short
/// (under a third of a second), small (a rise of a few pixels, never a slide
/// across the screen), and never blocking: the content is readable the whole
/// way through, and nothing waits on an animation to become interactive.
///
/// It also means NOTHING LOOPS. A spinner that never stops, a card that
/// pulses — those are fine for a few seconds and unbearable for an afternoon.
/// The one exception in this app is the brand drum, which is a logo.

  /// enough that a page of eight cards is fully in within 600ms. Past about
  /// 80ms a long page starts to feel like it is loading slowly.

  /// makes the same animation feel different on a bigger screen. 10 against
  /// `Entrance`'s own default of 18 — the console is denser than the phone,
  /// and a card that travels 18 next to a stat tile that does not reads as a

/// mobile home screen has used since day one. I wrote a second, identical
/// widget here first — same fade, same lift, same easeOutCubic, same one-shot
/// with a mounted guard on the delay — and deleted it once I found the
/// original. Two primitives doing one job is how the console and the phone app
/// end up animating differently for no reason anyone can name.
