/// File Name: 89-custom_empty_state.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `CustomEmptyState`.
/// Author: Manger Plus team
/// Created: 3/9/2026
///
/// The app's ONE empty state: the `lottie_empty` animation, no words.
///
/// WHY NO TEXT
/// -----------
/// Every list and table used to write its own sentence — "No orders yet", "No
/// customers match", "Nothing here". Same fact, four wordings, four
/// translations. The animation carries it.
///
/// EMPTY IS NOT AN ERROR
/// ---------------------
/// Do not reach for this when a read FAILED. "There is nothing here" and "we
/// could not find out what is here" are different facts; a failed read keeps
/// its own branch with a retry.
