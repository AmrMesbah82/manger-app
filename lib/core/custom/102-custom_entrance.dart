/// File Name: 102-custom_entrance.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `BrandBackdrop` and `Entrance` — the customer app's
///          motion language, lifted out of the splash screen so every screen
///          moves the same way.
/// Author: Manger Plus team
/// Created: 4/9/2026 - The customer screens were static next to the opener.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
///
/// The splash was the only animated thing in the app: drifting brand washes
/// behind a drum that fills, and copy that rises into place. Every screen after
/// it appeared fully formed and completely still, which made the opener read as
/// a different app's.
///
/// These two widgets are that opener's vocabulary, in a form a page can use:
///
///   BrandBackdrop  the two soft, slowly orbiting brand washes, behind any
///                  child. Purely decorative and non-interactive.
///   Entrance       one element fading up into place, with an [Entrance.index]
///                  so a column or a list arrives as a wave rather than all at
///                  once.
///
/// Both are deliberately cheap. The backdrop paints two blurred circles on one
/// repeating controller inside a RepaintBoundary; Entrance runs a single short
/// controller and then holds still forever. Neither rebuilds its child.

/// anything on it — which is why the opacities here are low enough that the
/// blobs never read as content.
